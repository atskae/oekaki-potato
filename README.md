# Oekaki Potato ðŸŽ¨ ðŸ¥”
Inspired by a snail mail exchange with one of my middle school art heros ðŸ™‚

My first goal is to learn how these Oekaki boards worked... and then figure out whether I can re-create some modern version.

## Directory Structure
* `doc/` My own notes
    * `shi-painter/run_shi_painter_locally.md`: Instructions on how to run Shi-painter locally in Chrome

## Links
* [NineChime](http://www.ninechime.com/products/)
    * This is where middle-school me downloaded some unverifed software and uploaded those files to some sketchy free web server to create an Oekaki board
* [Shi-painter Pro (hp.vector.co.jp)](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA016309/spainter/index_en.html)
    * This seems to be where the original download was for Shi-painter (and PaintBBS)
