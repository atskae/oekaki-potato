=====

PHP Basics:

	The most important thing to keep in mind while translating is how PHP handles quotes.

	In PHP, using double quotes as delimiters means the text will be scanned for special characters.  Double quotes ("), the dollar sign ($), backslashes, and various ASCII symbols must all be preceeded by a backslash, as follows:

		$var = " \" ' \$ \\";

		Note that the single quote is the only character not escaped.

		\n = New line, \t = tab.  These are somtimes used in e-mail message bodies.

	Using single quotes as delimiters means all text EXCEPT single quotes and backslashes will be used literally.  The drawback is that you cannot use any ASCII excape codes.

		$var = ' " \' $ \\ ';

	To help prevent confusion, using double quotes as delimiters is recommended.  If you need to use apostrophes, such as for contractions, or the dollar sign, then use single quotes for the variable delimiters.  For performance reasons, the English language file often uses single quotes.

	Translations that include HTML entities require double quotes.  Read the section "HTML Basics" below.

	When using double quotes in text, HTML entities are recommended:

		  &quot;Hello!&quot;
		&ldquot;Hello!&rdquot;

	A text editor with PHP syntax highlighting support is recommended.

	All lines must end with a semicolon.  If you are have parsing problems, check for mismatched quotes and the semicolon.

Encoding:

	UTF-8 is mandatory.

	Some messages are sent to the oekaki applets and *must* be in 8-bit ISO-8859-1 or else the applets will behave unpredictably.  Check each variable's context notes for more information.

	JavaScript messages will use the same encoding as the web browser.

	Wacintaki uses HTML entities for left and right double quotes.  Simply replace "&ldquo;" and "&rdquo;" with the proper HTML entities for your language.  Spanish/French quotes (<< >>) are "&laquo;" and "&raquo".

	E-mails may only be sent as plain text, not HTML.  UTF-8 in subject lines and message bodies is supported.

HTML Basics:

	All HTML links and entity attributes MUST use double quotes, not single quotes!

		$var = "<a href=\"{1}\">Good</a>";
		$var = '<a href="{1}">Good</a>';
		$var = "<a href='{1}'>WRONG</a>";

	Wacintaki language files must be HTML encoded.  Use symbol entities if possible:

		MANDATORY:
			      &  ->  &amp;
			< and >  ->  &lt; and &gt;

		OPTIONAL:
			<a href="#">"</a>  ->  <a href="#">&quot;</a>
			"this" or "that"   ->  &quot;this&quot; or &ldquo;that&rdquo;
			  "Wac and Tawny"  ->  &laquo;Wac y Tawny&raquo; (Spanish quote entities)
			  10 x 20 = 200    ->  10 &times; 20 = 200

Substitution:

	Variables are inserted into translations with a number in brackets.  The number refers to the parameter number used with the t() function.

		$lang['phrase'] = "{1} comments on {2} posts";

	The order of inserts may be changed:

		$lang['phrase'] = "{2} posts, {1} comments";
		$lang['phrase'] = "Posts {2} < Comments {1} < Backwards is language this";

Plural Basics:

	Wacintaki supports two plural forms with the singular zero cluase.  Whether zero is singular or plural is set with "$lang['cfg_zero_plural']" below.

	The syntax is "{p?x:y}" where p is the parameter number, x is singular, and y is plural.

		$lang['phrase'] = '{1} {1?member is:members are}' awesome.';
		$lang['phrase'] = 'There {1?is:are} {1} {1?value:values} found.';
		$lang['phrase'] = 'Set {1} {1?value:values}' on {2} {2?system:systems}';

	Embedding works, but use with caution and try to make it readable:

		$lang['something'] = 'There {1?is {1} value:are several values}.';

	Obviously, do not use curley brackets or colons within plural expressions.  Only the first question mark is used by the code, so multiple question marks are fine.

	Be clear, not clever.  {1?story:stories} is easier to read than stor{1?y:ies}.

	The language system isn't very powerful.  Please simplify sentence structure to avoid gotchas.

Gender:

	Sometimes the plural system provides the gender of a user.  Current usage is that masculine and neuter is the singular, feminine is the plural.  Check the context notes.

		// {1}=Gender
		$lang['phrase'] = "Send {1?him:her} a message.";

	If multiple people are involved, the gender will be feminine only if *all* people are female.  Some trial and error with embedding may be required to acheive the result you want:

		// {1}=Number of people, {2}=gender
		$lang['phrase'] = '{1?{2?The:The}:{2?The:The}} administrator{1?:s}';
		$lang['phrase'] = "{1?{2?L':Les }:{2?La :Las }}administrateur{1?:s}";

		Note the change to double quotes to properly handle "L'" above.

$lang['faq_answer'][0] = '<p>Oekaki is a Japanese term that roughly translates to &ldquo;doodle&rdquo; or &ldquo;scribble.&rdquo;  On the Internet, oekaki boards are bulletin boards or forums dedicated to drawing pictures that are drawn using a paint program that runs in a web browser.  Traditionally, early oekakis were simple pictures drawn with few colors on a canvas measuring 300 &times; 300 pixels, and they were posted sequentially, rather than in a threaded gallery format.  Oekaki boards started showing up on Japanese web sites around 1998, were only available in Japanese, and were often dedicated to anime and video game fan art.</p>

<p>Today, the drawing programs are much more sophisticated and allow more complex drawings of different sizes and in multiple layers, but the oekaki bulletin board format usually remains the same.  Oekakis are largely dedicated to original work you have drawn yourself.  Photographs or work you did not create yourself are discouraged, and in most cases are not allowed.  Some oekaki boards allow you to upload pictures from your computer, but most do not.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;oekaki&rdquo; may refer to both oekaki drawings and an oekaki board.  When someone draws an oekaki, they are drawing a picture.  When someone draws on an Oekaki, or looks at oekakis, they are usually referring to participating on an oekaki board.</p>';

Wacintaki was forked from a previous open-source oekaki known as OekakiPoteto, written by Theo Chakkapark and Marcello BastÃ©a-Forte.  Old versions of the fork were known as Wacintaki Poteto, but now the board is simply named Wacintaki.</p>

<p>If you are interested in installing Wacintkai on your web site, visit the Wacintaki home page or the NineChime software support forum for more information.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][2] = 'How do I start drawing?';

$lang['faq_answer'][2] = '<p>Wacintaki requires registration before you may draw.  If you are registered, you may begin drawing by clicking on &ldquo;Draw&rdquo; on the menu bar.  Note that administrators may revoke your ability to draw, revoke your registration, or even ban you at any time if you misbehave.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][3] = 'What is the difference between drawing and uploading?';

$lang['faq_answer'][3] = '<p>Oekaki boards allow you to draw pictures with a custom paint program that runs in your web browser.  Some oekaki boards will also allow you to upload an image from your computer, but this is at the discression of the oekaki owner.  Some oekaki boards will allow all members to upload files, however, most boards will only allow specific members to upload.  Please check the board rules before asking for the ability to upload images.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][4] = 'How do I start animating?';

$lang['faq_answer'][4] = '<p>Some paint programs allow you to record your actions as you draw, so other members may see how you work.  After clicking &ldquo;Draw&rdquo; on the menu bar, you will be given an option to enable animations.  Note that some paint programs do not support animations, but they may require you to click the animation option if you want to draw your picture in multiple layers.</p>

<p>Animations will only show your actions while drawing.  You cannot create cartoons or videos, or edit the animations.  If you click &ldquo;undo&rdquo; in a paint program, your last action will not show up in the animation.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][5] = 'I can\'t see or start the paint program.';

$lang['faq_answer'][5] = '<p>Most of the paint programs are Java applets.  If your web browser says it does not have the correct plug-in, try downloading Java from <a href="http://www.java.com">www.Java.com</a>.  Java is a software platform created by Sun Microsystems and is now distributed by Oracle.</p>

<p>Many PCs already have Java installed.  Java on the Macintosh is provided by Apple, and is known to have problems running the oekaki applets.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][6] = 'I can\'t retouch my pictures.  The canvas is blank!';

$lang['faq_answer'][6] = '<p>Older versions of Java have problems importing pictures, so make sure you are using a recent version of Java.  You may also have to enable animation support to retouch pictures.  If you are retouching a complex picture with a long animation, you may have to wait a minute before the picture will show up in the canvas as the paint program loads the animation.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][7] = 'I lost my password.';

$lang['faq_answer'][7] = '<p>You may recover your password <a href="lostpass.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you can\'t get your password back with password recovery, tell the owner of the board, and he or she can give you a new password.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][8] = 'I can\'t logout.';

$lang['faq_answer'][8] = '<p>This is likely a web browser problem.  You should empty your browser cookies.  A cookie is a small tag of information that lets a server know who you are.  Most browsers have an option to clear cookies from the &ldquo;Tools->Options&rdquo; menu.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][9] = 'My picture didn\'t post, or I wasn\'t able to comment, and lost my picture!';

$lang['faq_answer'][9] = '<p>Your picture may not be lost.  If the picture finished uploading, but you were unable to comment, go to &ldquo;Administration->Recover Pics&rdquo; to recover it.  Your information has still saved, including the time it took for you to draw it.  If you have trouble, the administrator may recover pictures for you, or upload a screen capture you took using the &ldquo;Print Scrn&rdquo; key.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  Pictures saved using a screen capture may be very large and in a format not compatible with Wacintaki.  Please tell an administrator about your lost picture <strong>before</strong> sending a huge picture file to an admin\'s e-mail address.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][10] = 'Why can\'t I see any e-mail addresses?';

$lang['faq_answer'][10] = '<p>To help protect e-mail addresses from spam, you must be logged into your account to see other peoples\' addresses in their profile or the memberlist.</p>

<p>You will always be able to see admin e-mails, but you will have to substitute the anti-spam character with the &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][11] = 'What happened to the chat / mailbox?';

$lang['faq_answer'][11] = '<p>Wacintaki allows administrators to disable the chat and mailbox systems normally found in OekakiPoteto.  The chat system uses a lot of bandwidth and some servers may not be able to use it.  If the mailbox has been disabled, you may send e-mails to people directly by viewing that person\'s profile or the memberlist.  Note that you must be a member and logged in to see e-mail addresses.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][12] = 'How may I send a mailbox message to someone?';

$lang['faq_answer'][13] = '<p>If it is set, at a specific date, all users who haven\'t logged in within the specified time will automatically be removed from the board. To prevent this from happening, ask an administrator to give you an Immunity flag, or log into the board on a regular basis.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][14] = 'What is considered an adult picture?';

$lang['faq_answer'][14] = '<p>As oekaki is an international passtime, the definition of an adult picture varies.  Usually this means any material of a mature nature, suitable only for people at least 18 years of age.  This material includes aggressive violence, nudity, or anything of a sexual or explicit nature.  Some oekaki boards do not allow adult content, so read the rules to see if any additional or alternative conditions have been specified by the administrators.</p>

<p>If an oekaki board has been rated for adults only, you must submit an age statement before you may register.  If you cannot view adult pictures and would like to see them, you must select &ldquo;Edit Profile,&rdquo; and make sure the &ldquo;Allow Adult Images&rdquo; checkbox is selected.</p>';


$lang['faq_question'][15] = 'Why are some pictures shrunken into a thumbnail, while others are not?';

$lang['faq_answer'][15] = '<p>Images become thumbnails based on a number of factors, including the filesize of your image, and what thumbnail mode the administrator has selected for the board.  You may change thumbnail and layout modes in <a href="editprofile.php">&ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo;</a> if the administrator allows members to choose their own view modes.</p>';
