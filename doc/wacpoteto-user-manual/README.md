# wacpoteto User Manual
Notes on the user manual: `wacpoteto-1.6.7/documentation/manual.html`.

## Preguntas
* What triggers the `install.php` to run after you upload the `wacpoteto` files and go to your web URL?
    * I guess you just run the script yourself?
* Why the name `Wacintaki/Poteto`?

## Things I didn't know back then but now do
* Unix, PHP, MySQL, `chmod`
    * "Determining if you are a newbie" I am technically not anymore, wow -sheds one happy tear-

## Realizations/笑
* `BBS` (as in PaintBBS) stands for "Bulletin Board System"
* The manual mentions AIM (笑) if your bandwidth is too low
* `chmod 775`: allow user `u` to read/write/execute, but only allow the group `g` and others `o` with read/write only.
    * [source](https://askubuntu.com/questions/932713/what-is-the-difference-between-chmod-x-and-chmod-755)
* FTP ASCII vs binary mode
    * ASCII: when sending ASCII files (`.txt`) and end-of-line differs between systems
    * binary: raw data
* `Safety saves` ahahaha.
* (on running PHP scripts) "safe mode must be off" oh man.
